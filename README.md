# Reusables

Welcome to Reusables! This is a setup for a collection of reusable components, libs, hooks, and utility functions for react.

The idea came to stop moving my reusables from one project to another. Why not have a platform where it can be accessed by me and others, and others can contribute to it?

## Setup

Reusables uses Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It uses the Shadcn CLI to install components or any block of code, just like you have in Shadcn and FumaDocs for easy documentation.

## Documentation

Visit [Reusables Documentation](https://reusables.vercel.app/docs) to view the documentation and see what we have for you.
