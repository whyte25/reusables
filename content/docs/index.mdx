# Reusables

A curated collection of production-ready components, hooks, and utilities that you can seamlessly integrate into your applications.

## What is Reusables?

This is **NOT** just another component library. Instead, it's a carefully crafted collection of reusable building blocks that developers can copy, paste, and adapt for their specific needs. Think of it like shadcn UI

## Vision

Every developer faces the challenge of recreating similar components and utilities across different projects. Reusables aims to solve this by providing a centralized, open-source repository of battle-tested code that can accelerate development without adding unnecessary dependencies.

## Key Features

- Copy-and-paste friendly code
- Production-ready components
- Customizable building blocks
- Modern development patterns

## Getting Started

Browse our collection of components and utilities, copy or install what you need, and integrate them directly into your project.

## Contributing

Reusables is an open-source project that thrives on community contributions. Whether you have a useful component, a helpful hook, or an efficient utility function, we welcome your input.

## Credits & Inspiration

This project is inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Like shadcn/ui, Reusables offer both copy-paste functionality and Shadcn CLI for component or any block of code installation. We're grateful for their innovative approach to component distribution.
